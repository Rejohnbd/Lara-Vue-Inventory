## Initial Project Setup Laravel Vue Inventory

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- composer require laravel/ui:^2.4
- php artisan ui vue --auth
- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm run watch
- npm i vue-router@3.5.4
